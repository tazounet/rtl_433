rtl_433
=======

rtl_433 turns your Realtek RTL2832 based DVB dongle into a 433.92MHz generic data receiver

How to add support for unsupported sensors
------------------------------------------

Read the Test Data section at the bottom.


Installation instructions:
--------------------------

Compiling rtl_433 requires [rtl-sdr](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr) to be installed.

Installation using cmake:

    cd rtl_433/
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    make install

Installation using autoconf:

    cd rtl_433/
    autoreconf --install
    ./configure
    make
    make install


Running:
--------

    rtl_433 -h

```
Usage:	= Tuner options =
	[-d <device index>] (default: 0)
	[-g <gain>] (default: 0 for auto)
	[-f <frequency>] [-f...] Receive frequency(s) (default: 433920000 Hz)
	[-p <ppm_error>] (default: 0)
	[-s <sample rate>] Set sample rate (default: 250000 Hz)
	[-S] Force sync output (default: async)
	= Demodulator options =
	[-R <device>] Listen only for the specified remote device (can be used multiple times)
	[-l <level>] Change detection level used to determine pulses [0-32767] (default: 8000)
	[-z <value>] Override short value in data decoder
	[-x <value>] Override long value in data decoder
	= Analyze/Debug options =
	[-a] Analyze mode. Print a textual description of the signal. Disables decoding
	[-A] Pulse Analyzer. Enable pulse analyzis and decode attempt
	[-D] Print debug info on event (repeat for more info)
	= File I/O options =
	[-t] Test signal auto save. Use it together with analyze mode (-a -t). Creates one file per signal
		 Note: Saves raw I/Q samples (uint8, 2 channel). Preferred mode for generating test files
	[-r <filename>] Read data from input file instead of a receiver
	[-m <mode>] Data file mode for input / output file (default: 0)
		 0 = Raw I/Q samples (uint8, 2 channel)
		 1 = AM demodulated samples (int16)
		 2 = FM demodulated samples (int16) (experimental)
		 Note: If output file is specified, input will always be I/Q
	[<filename>] Save data stream to output file (a '-' dumps samples to stdout)

Examples:

| Command | Description
|---------|------------
| `rtl_433` | Will run the software in receive mode. Some sensor data can be received and decoded.
| `rtl_433 -a` | Will run in analyze mode and you will get a text description of the received signal.
| `rtl_433 -a -t` | Will run in analyze mode and save a test file per detected signal (gfile###.data). Format is uint8, 2 channels.
| `rtl_433 -r file_name` | Will run with a saved test file as input data.
| `rtl_433 file_name` | Will save the received signal data stream in a file (file may become large).

This software is mostly useable for developers right now.


Test Data
------------

Recordings of the transmitted signals are vital in trying to figure out the signal format. So before you
request anything make sure you have recorded a proper set of test signals (10 maybe) together with
with the decoded reference values. Then take pictures of the device, preferable even the pcb. Then
document as much as possible about the device. Now when you have all this, check out the rtl_433_tests
repository.

https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433_tests

Follow the existing structure as best as possible and send a pull request.
Now you can add an issue about wanting support for an unsupported format.
